# Second Assignment - Bin packing
A brute force and a greedy (First Fit) implementations of the bin packing problem followed by an automated and a benchmarking testing routines and a `timeit` analysis.

Read first the `"LaTeX_solution.pdf"` to understand the pseudocode and my reasonings, then check if the following packages are installed (random, timeit, numpy, scipy) or consider to istall them by running the following lines:
```
$ pip install random
$ pip install timeit
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install scipy
```
Now, you are ready to run the "second.py" python code!
