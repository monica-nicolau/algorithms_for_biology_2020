# First Assignment - Knapsack with incompatibilities
A revisitation of the famous Knapsack problem with the introduction of incompatibilities between the objects.

Read first the `"LaTeX_solution.pdf"` to understand the pseudocode and my reasonings, then check if the following packages are installed (random, timeit, numpy, scipy) or consider to istall them by running the following lines:
```
$ pip install random
$ pip install timeit
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install scipy
```
Now, you are ready to run the "first.py" python code!
